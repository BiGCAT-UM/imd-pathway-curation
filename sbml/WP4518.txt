This pathway shows diseases related to the biosynthesis and degradation of glutathione. Diseases resulting from an enzyme deficiency are highlighted in pink. The four genetic defects, causing the diseases, are all inherited as autosomal recessive traits. All patients with gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency are diagnosed with hemolytic anemia. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is classified in mild, moderate and severe. Patient diagnosed with mild glutathione synthetase deficiency suffer from hemolytic anemia only, while patient with the moderate and severe form show neurological symptoms, metabolic acidosis and bacterial infections as well. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 42 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
